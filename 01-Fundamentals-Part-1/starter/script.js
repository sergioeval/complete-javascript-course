// conventions and rules for namming variables
// more than 1 words firstName 
// or first_name this is more popular in ther languages
// we can not use number in the vairable at the start

//new is areserved keyword in js
// another is reserved is function
//name is a reserved keyword 

// do not start a variable with uppercase 

// contats are usually write in uppercase like 
let PI = 3.1415;

// variables should be self descriptive 
// example is
let myFirstJob = 'programmer';
let myCurrentJob = 'Teacher'

//bad example is 
let job1 = 'Programmer'
let job2 = 'Teacher'
